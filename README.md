#API REST

API developed using Mojolicious::Lite running on CGI mode just for educational purpose.

##.htaccess

The .htaccess file has a trick to run the script in a "pretty URL" way.

Instead of run the script like *http://domain.com/api/index.pl/noticia/666* we just need to run *http://domain.com/api/noticia/666* and that's it, we don't need to have that ugly "index.pl" from the link anymore
